CALCULATOR:
-USE CASE: STRICTLY PERSONAL USE
    - THIS MEANS WE ARE LOOKING AT THE DAILY LIFESTYLE OF A PERSON AND SEEING HOW THIS CAUSES EMISSIONS
    - THIS IS NOT FOR BUSINESS USE, HOWEVER IN THE FUTURE, FUNCTIONALITY CAN BE PUT INTO PLACE FOR BUSINESS EMISSIONS
-DAILY LIFESTYLE OF A PERSON:
    - COMMUTE (SCOPE 1 IF CAR)
    - ELECTRICITY, GAS, OIL BILL (SCOPE 2)
    - WATER BILL (SCOPE 3)
    - DIET (SCOPE 3)

CALCULATION:

PERSONAL PROFILE:
-INCOME BRACKET 
-VEHICLES OWNED (BUSINESS USE, PERSONAL USE) -> MENTION POSSIBILITY TO SCALE. mileage
-ELECTRICITY BILL -> TRANSLATION TO KG/CO2
-HEATING (GAS AND OIL BILL * AVERAGE EMISSION FACTOR FOR BOTH)
-FLIGHT MILEAGE
-WASTE/RECYCLING
-LIFESTYLE PURCHASES (INC DIET)

CARBON FOOTPRINT BASED ON LIFESTYLE:
CERTAIN SCOPE 3 FACTORS YOU CANNOT CONTROL: SUCH AS EMISSIONS DUE TO WORK (TRAVEL, EQUIPMENT ETC)
^THESE WOULD COME UNDER EMISSIONS OF YOUR COMPANY (EVEN IF YOU'RE THE OWNER)

HAS TO BE NOTED THESE CAlCULATIONS ARE BASED ON THE LAYMAN. THE ULTRA RICH OBVIOUSLY HAVE VARY DIFFERENT LIFESTYLES
SO A DIFFERENT CALCULATORY METHODOLOGY WOULD NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED FOR THIS VARIATION IN LIFESTYLE. HOWEVER, MANY
FACTORS WHICH THEY EMIT HIGHLY IN, SUCH AS AIR MILEAGE AND LIFESTYLE PURCHASES, CAN BE TAKEN AS SIMILAR, AS THE CALCULATIONS
ARE BASED ON KG/CO2 PER Â£ SPENT.
